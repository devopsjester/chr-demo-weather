# Sample Weather App

## Prompt engineering
Use the following prompts with GitHub copilot:

- Get a city and state based on a zip code using the zipopotam.us API
- Get the local temperature for the city and state using the openweathermap.org API
- use logging for errors and information
- use better error handling
- look for vulnerabillities
- move the api key to a configuration file
- prompt for a zip code if none is provided at the command line
